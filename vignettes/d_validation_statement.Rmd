## Liability

As noted in the GPL-3 License, neither the authors nor any person or
institution associated with the creation, production or distribution of
`DescrTab2` is liable of any damages caused by the use of the software:

> IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
> WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR
> CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
> INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
> ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT
> NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR
> LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM
> TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER
> PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

## Unit tests

`DescrTab2` features a suite of unit tests. The percentage of
lines of codes covered by at least one unit tests is reported via the
`covr` package.
Most of these unit tests only check whether the code associated with
it produces errors. This aims to ensure that the various options in
`DescrTab2` work error-free with a variations of possible input datasets
and edge-cases.

## Manual external software comparisons

Comparisons of the results produced by `DescrTab2` with other software
are not automated. The user may feel free to perform such comparisons by
themselves. An exemplary comparison can be examined in this
[document](c_other_software_comparison.html).

## Dependencies

`DescrTab2` relies on various other packages to perform its designated purpose.
Most of the imported packages are neccesary to facilitate tasks related to
data-wrangling and output formatting, namely `?utils`, `?dplyr`, `?rlang`, `?tibble`, `?stringr`, `?forcats`, `?magrittr`, `?tidyselect`, `?scales`, `?cli`, `?kableExtra`, `?flextable` and `?officer`.
The pre-implemented summary statistics (mean, sd, etc.) make use of functions
provided for this purpose in base R (see `?base` and `?stats`).
The test functions used for the calculcation of p-values are mostly from
base R (e.g. `?t.test` from `?stats`) and the recommended packages
(e.g. `?lme` from `?nlme` for the Mixed Model Anova p-value).
Notable exceptions are the Cochrane Q Test from the `?DescTools` package (`?DescTools::CochranQTest`)
and the Fisher-Boschloo test from the `?exact2x2` package (`?exact2x2::boschloo`).
